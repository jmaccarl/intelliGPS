Authors: Jenna MacCarley & Aditya Ranganath

Abstract:
Our project aims to explore power consumption reduction in wearable devices with standalone GPS functionality. We wish to determine the potential energy savings resulting from powering down the GPS receiver as needed, without sacrificing tracking accuracy, using cues from onboard sensors such as a vibration/shock sensor that indicate if a user is moving or not. We will explore different configurations for timing when to turn the GPS off, and evaluate the potential energy savings vs. loss in accuracy for a variety of real-world scenarios of use.
